This is my Vim config.

It makes use of the pathogen[https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen] plugin manager, which I highly recommend for installing any plugins.
Some highlights: 
* I use the GothamColorScheme[https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham]
* I just started using VimAirline[https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline], which is a great status/timeline in the file you're currently working in.
* Checkout my .vimrc for little details!
